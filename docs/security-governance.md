# Security And Governance Layer

This repo now includes a manifest policy audit and admission-policy examples.

## Commands

- `make policy-audit` writes `.local/reports/policy_audit.json`.
- `make demo` also emits the same audit report.

## What Is Checked

- Restricted pod security labels.
- Resource requests and limits.
- Dropped capabilities and read-only root filesystems.
- Kueue queue admission, KEDA scaled jobs, and incident priority classes.
- Mutable image tags and missing digest references.

## Why The Audit Flags Image Immutability

The local manifests still use illustrative `:latest` image references. The audit deliberately flags that as a production gap. In a real release, images should be scanned, signed, and referenced by digest after provenance generation.
